In Q4, there are values associated with each of the nodes of the binary tree. 
In your code, provide the following two options:
(1) read values of the nodes from an array (see example below)
(2) assign random values to the nodes.

While grading your assignment, the TA will replace the array in your 
code with test values to check the output.

For example, the following array represents the tree 
given below the dotted line. Note: The tree below the dotted line is only 
to illustrate which values in the array are assigned to which nodes. 
You don't have to read the tree in that format.

{29, 6, 11, 15, 5, 10, 20, 1, 3, 4, 2, 15, 45, 10, 50}
