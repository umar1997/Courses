The Algorithm works in the following way: 
1) Start with full tank 
2) Fill the tank to a limit where the final destination is reachable. If the tank is not reachable with current tank capacity then just fill the tank to full. 
3) Move to next destination and decrease the tank accordingly until the next destination is not reachable. Move to Step 2 if final destination is not reached and next stop is also not reachable. Else move to step 4. 
4) Final destination is reached. Let there be a station O where the car stops which is more optimal than the location stopped in A. 
The location O can be either of the two: 
1) O is reached before A, which makes O less optimal than A as the car stopping at O increases time while at A you donâ€™t stop at all. Making A more optimal than O.
2) O is reached after A. This contradicts our algorithm as in our algorithm the car only stops when the next destination is not reachable. So O would have only been made reachable if the car in Optimal solution already stopped before to fuel up. Which makes time taken to reach lesser than O, making A a more optimal location to stop at as compared to O. 
So this proves that our algorithm is as optimal or better performing than that of optimal solution.
